# USA-Airline-Flight-Delay
I analysed the  USA airline flight delay which has ove 5million plus dataset

##**Introduction**##:The USA AIrline Flight was analysed in other to make meaningful decision such as knowing the most reliable and least reliable airline,the most reason for flight canacellations and many more

##**Objective**##: the objective of this analysis is to  assess flight flight performance accross several section such as flight delay, weather, cancellation reasons
flight volume and performance by location, overall flight delay percentage##. e.t.c

##1.Departure Delays: full Understanding on the percentage of delayed flights and the reasons behind cancellations

##2.analysing  how flight volumes vary across months and days of the week

##3.Identifying the most and least reliable airlines in terms of on-time departures

**##Key Insight##**

##Flight Volume## flight vary by month, this shows that the month with the hights flight occures in the 7th month(July) total of 520,718 flight
#light vary by day of the week occured in day 4(wednessday) total of 872,521 flight

**##Departure Delay##**

##the average percentage delay is 36.5 in 2015, as this causes customer disatisfaction.

**##Flight cancellation##**
##The percentage of cancellations due to weather, and  airline issues,helps identify external and internal factors affecting flight schedules
##the percentage of weather is 54%  and that of airline/carrier is 28% which indicate that external factor has more percentage effect in delay.
**
##Recommendation##**

##For airlines with a significant percentage of cancellations due to weather (as indicated by cancellation_reasons = 'B'), consider building more robust weather contingency plans. This could involve investing in better weather forecasting technology or establishing better communication channels to handle delays and cancellations proactively.

##The least reliable airline (in terms of on-time departure) should address operational bottlenecks to improve its service reliability.

##Airlines should ensure that passengers are informed in real-time about flight statuses, especially in the event of cancellations or delays.

##Customer service teams need to be better equipped to handle weather-related disruptions and airline-caused delays, providing timely assistance for rebooking and compensation.

##For weather-related cancellations, airlines should improve communication with passengers and possibly invest in technologies to predict and mitigate the impact of weather disruptions

**##conclusion**

##By looking closely at key data points like how many flights there are, the percentage of delays, cancellations, and overall reliability, airlines can get a better sense of how well ##they're operating. With these insights, they can make improvements, such as reducing delays, cutting down on cancellations, and providing a smoother experience for passengers. In the ##long run, these changes will help airlines run more efficiently, improve their reputation, and make passengers happier with their service
